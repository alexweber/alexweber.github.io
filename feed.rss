<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>

<ul>
<li>Ghost 0.10.0</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/raccoonyy/buster">This buster fork</a></li>
<li>Python 2.7</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm on a Mac and I had to add this to my dotfiles to get Python running properly: <code>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages</code></p>

<h5 id="steps">Steps</h5>

<p>You basically want to follow the great instructions in the linked blog posts below and stop at the point where you generate it with Buster.</p>

<p>Although it seems like it works, query strings in the URLs and some html entities get mangled so I ended up having to <em>hack the forked Buster</em>.  I'd fork the fork but it's a one-off so no point.</p>

<p>Here's my hacked buster.py file: <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexweber/fdc86aa225e7294c17dfb375e846b599">https://gist.github.com/alexweber/fdc86aa225e7294c17dfb375e846b599</a></p>

<p>It's got a new sanitation function (taken from <a href="https://gist.github.com/Zuckonit/9044051">this gist</a>), some extra helper stuff, some hard-coded swill and finally ties it all together to generate not only the posts but also Ghost's static pages and the rss feed, conveniently renamed and moved for Github pages.</p>

<p>The end-result is that I can run <code>python buster.py generate</code> and <code>python buster.py deploy</code> and it now just works!</p>

<p>It's written from a local <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> instance, gutted with <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a>... how very hipster!</p>

<p>The general idea was to get <em>something</em> online, seeing as my old <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> blog has been offline for 2 or maybe 3 years now... (who's really counting?)</p>

<p>Maintaining a Drupal site and a VPS was a hassle I no longer cared for so that was that. I also tried going full-<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> but that a bit too laborious... so that's how we ended up with Ghost + Buster. (The details of how it worked out probably merit their own post)</p>

<p>As for the old content, it's ok that vanished into a little black hole in the interwebs, it'll be like it never happened... instead, we're starting fresh and with 100% more gremlin references.</p>

<p>So that's that cherry popped, less mundane posts coming up next. Bye now.</p></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
